# EarthquakeStats

Welcome to the EarthquakeStats project. This repository contains two main applications: Apollo GraphQL Server + Express + MongoDB application named `node-app`, and a Next + React + Apollo Client application named `react-app`. The project simply shows the list of earthquakes in the table and manages CRUD operations for the Earthquake entity.

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx dev react-app
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build react-app
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project react-app
```
